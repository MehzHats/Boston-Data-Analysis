## Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/@mehzhats/write-a-data-science-blog-post-7f595ed942b6

## Project Motivation
The Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program includes the project "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

For this project, I used the Airbnb Boston Dataset. The information represents the listing actions of homestays in Boston, Washington, as part of the Airbnb Inside project. You may access the [original dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).

The following questions are the main focus of this project:
1. Which column has the most impact on the price?
2. Which neighbourhood in the listings are the most and least expensive?
3. Two parts.
    - What are the least busy times of the year to visit Boston?
    - By how low do the prices get?

## Libraries
I have used Python 3 for this project. Following is the list libraries I used for the completion of this project.

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
