## Project Motivation
The Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program includes the project "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

For this project, I used the Airbnb Boston Dataset. The information represents the listing actions of homestays in Boston, Washington, as part of the Airbnb Inside project. You may access the [original dataset here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston).

The following questions are the main focus of this project:
1. Which column has the most impact on the price?
2. Which neighbourhood in the listings are the most and least expensive?
3. Two parts.
    - What are the least busy times of the year to visit Boston?
    - By how low do the prices get?
